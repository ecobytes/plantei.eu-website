Caravel CMS 0.2
=====================

First commits on 0.2a.

WAT?
---------------------
Caravel is a php CMS based on Laravel. The stack goes something like this:

 - server: php, mysql
 - client: angular, less, bootstrap,

Installing and running
---------------------

We've been putting a lot of effort in making this fast and easy go [Check the wiki](https://github.com/fimdomeio/CaravelCms/wiki/install) for instructions.

Why
---------------------
Tired of passing a project to someone and having him/her take a week to get the development environment running. So here it is.

I'm making this a super coder friendly cms. The coder admin area is going to be full of goodies like a code generator, on site documentation, Caravel and project specific issues tracking.
